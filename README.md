GeoBullet
===============

Bullet example files, from basic to complex ones with mechanical/geotechnical perspective.
The repository contains both very simple and very complicated examples.

It is shown that Bullet can be used as an advanced discrete element software in the simulation
of geotechnical engineering related problems.
Moreover, it has the capability of simulation of soft bodies using FEM or PBM approaches.

Its likely Bullet to be coupled with SPH code "fluids" to be able to simulate fluids interacting
with rigid and/or soft bodies.
