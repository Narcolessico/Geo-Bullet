{"name":"Geo-Bullet","tagline":"Simulation of granular media by Bullet physics engine with Geotechnical engineering perspective.","body":"### Bullet physics engine\r\nBullet is a physics engine initially developed for video games and animations purposes. However, it is written based on physical laws. It is fast,robust and handy. To gain more information on Bullet, readers can view [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) on GitHub.\r\nBullet consists of three major modules:\r\n* Rigid body module: which is based on [contact dynamics](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167663609000386) approach.\r\n* Soft body module: which is based on spring-mass systems (application of FEM is also feasible).\r\n* Fluid module: using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)- coupling is in progress...\r\n\r\nBesides, Bullet comes with very nice features, such as Voronoi fracturing, CAD file importers, etc.\r\n\r\n### Simulation of granular media using Bullet\r\nSince Bullet uses contact dynamics as rigid body solver, soil granules can be modelled as discrete objects with a wide range of geometries. In addition, in the cases in which deformable bodies such as reinforcements, membranes, etc. are associated in the simulation, they can be modelled as softbodies.\r\n\r\n[![Direct shear test on large gravels](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n3GHt2No0wk/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3GHt2No0wk \"Direct shear test on large gravels\")\r\nDirect shear test on large gravels \r\n\r\n[![Triaxial test on metal beads](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LC386718Xnw/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW21N8B50PQ \"Triaxial test on metal beads\")\r\nTriaxial test on metal beads\r\n\r\n[![Simulation of Membrane in triaxial test](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BJFgiLXY-K0/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJFgiLXY-K0 \"Simulation of Membrane in triaxial test\")\r\nSimulation of Membrane in triaxial test\r\n\r\n[![Progressive development of failure plane](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xxVcSnmjH4o/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVcSnmjH4o \"Progressive development of failure plane\")\r\nProgressive development of failure plane\r\n\r\n[![Voronoi shattering of a block to generate soil-like objects](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SO-636okrk/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SO-636okrk \"Voronoi shattering of a block to generate soil-like objects\")\r\nVoronoi shattering of a block to generate soil-like objects\r\n\r\n[![Gravel pluviation through a funnel](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rx4VySpCN8s/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx4VySpCN8s \"Gravel pluviation through a funnel\")\r\nGravel pluviation through a funnel\r\n\r\n[![Vibratory densification of gravels](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6fU7pL3lyIY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6NC6fZBzng \"Vibratory densification of gravels\")\r\nVibratory densification of gravels\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nIn order to use GeoBullet, Bullet must be installed already (preferably in ~/Bullet/bullet3/) folder. Moreover, '[Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction)', '[python](https://www.python.org/)' and '[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)' are recommended to be installed. The code is tested under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, with '[gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)' compiler.\r\nEvery folder in the code repository represent an example, and the codes are written in a way to be self-explanatory, so, with less effort it can be understood.\r\nThe file 'variables.h' in each folder represents the main variables and the associated magnitudes for the simulations.\r\nFor visualisation purposes, several writers are provided. The output of the writers are recommended to be opened by paraview software.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCurrently, GeoBullet is maintained by [Ehsan Izadi](https://github.com/Ehsanizadi), but cooperation from other researchers are gladly welcomed. In the case of encountering any problems and difficulties, please ask your questions on [GeoBullet forums on GitHub](https://github.com/Ehsanizadi/Geo-Bullet/issues).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
